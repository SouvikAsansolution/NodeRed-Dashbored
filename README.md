# NodeRed Dashbored
A more customizable dashboard for NodeRed, not to be confused with the [NodeRed Dashboard](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-dashboard) project.

This project is very much in the early development stages. In general the project aims to provide a simple customizable ui experience.

# Features
* Widgets!
* Configuration within the NodeRed flow(s)
* Custom CSS
* Compatibility with older browsers (We use Android tablets with outdated browsers and need to support them)
* Adding custom widgets

# Installation
Coming soon!! 

# Development
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/haydendonald/NodeRed-Dashbored/wiki)

# Limitations
* There is probably no or very little security. Data will probably be sent in plain text so don't expect any encryption.

# Known Issues
if the user clicks back on the password dialog it will action that action when the user clicks something else

# Todo
* Widgets / dashboreds need to be able to remember their state after redeploy
* Finish the dashbored settings
* Finish the server settings
* Fix the weather
